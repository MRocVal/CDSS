This repository contains a web-based application built with Streamlit, designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing tumor types quickly and easily based on metabolite concentration data. This tool enables doctors to classify tumors by leveraging data-driven insights, facilitating faster diagnostic decisions.

## Objective

The goal of this application is to streamline the tumor classification process, making it easier for medical professionals to interpret metabolite concentration data and gain diagnostic insights. By uploading metabolite data, doctors can quickly obtain probabilistic classifications and recommendations, supporting more efficient and accurate clinical decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Ease of Use**: Designed for intuitive navigation, allowing medical professionals to focus on diagnosis without requiring technical expertise in data science.
- **Fast and Reliable Classification**: Provides a rapid diagnostic suggestion based on machine learning models trained on metabolite concentration patterns associated with specific tumor types.
- **Downloadable Results**: Users can download the classification results as a `.csv` file, facilitating documentation and further analysis.

## Usage Overview

1. **Upload**: The doctor uploads a `.csv` file containing the required metabolite concentration data.
2. **Get Results**: The application instantly provides probabilistic tumor classifications and diagnostic suggestions.
3. **Downloadable Report**: For easy documentation and further review, results can be downloaded directly.

## Access the Application
